This toy project was primarily done for Java language learning, as I did not do it a huge amount of time without a really interesting task. I use here a very powerful metaprogramming technique, based on **object graph** interpretation (*) and structural match transformations. I lost a huge amount of time trying to advocate and evangelize this idea among developers, compiler designers, and computer hobbits. Nobody needs it as ideas without implementation have no value. So now it's my secret weapon the same as Paul Graham said about Lisp he used for self-bootstrapping development. [I publicated few releases](https://github.com/ponyatov/JL) under the MIT license, but this thing is not supported, has master branch in broken state on GitHub, and available as-is. I'm not going to do any public support, documentation writing, consulting, code refactoring for readability and other ritual squats. If somebody wants it, it is OpenSource, do it yourself or pay.

(*) like Lisp does with lists, that's a fully reflective and roughly said homoiconic system on a top of Marvin Minsky's frame model for generic knowledge representation & reasoning
